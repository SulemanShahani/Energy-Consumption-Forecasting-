# Time Series Forecasting for Energy Consumption in PJME Region

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict future energy consumption (in megawatts) for the PJME region using historical hourly energy consumption data. The forecasting model leverages various time-based features, Fourier series terms, and lagged variables to capture seasonality and long-term trends. The model is trained and evaluated using XGBoost, a powerful and flexible gradient boosting framework.

## Data Preprocessing
### Loading Data:
- The dataset contains hourly energy consumption data for the PJME region.
- The data is indexed by datetime to facilitate time series analysis.

### Train/Test Split:
- Training set: Data before January 1, 2015.
- Test set: Data from January 1, 2015, onwards.
- This split ensures that the model is evaluated on a separate period to test its predictive power on unseen data.

### Visualization:
- A plot is created to visualize the train/test split.
- This helps in understanding the distribution and patterns in the data over time.

## Feature Creation
### Time-Based Features:
- Features such as hour, day of the week, quarter, month, year, and day of the year are extracted from the datetime index.
- These features help the model understand the temporal patterns in the data.

### Fourier Terms:
- Fourier series terms are added to capture seasonality.
- These terms help in modeling periodic patterns in the data.

### Lagged Variables:
- Lagged variables (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, 3 years back) are created to capture long-term seasonality.
- These variables help the model understand historical patterns and their impact on future values.

## Model Training and Evaluation
### Scaling:
- Features are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data.
- Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process.

### Time Series Cross-Validation:
- Time series cross-validation with forward chaining is employed to validate the model on sequential data.
- This method ensures that the model is validated on future data points without any data leakage from the future to the past.

### Model Training:
- An XGBoost regressor is trained using the created features.
- XGBoost is chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex patterns in the data.

### Evaluation:
- The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- RMSE is a standard metric for regression tasks that penalizes large errors, providing a clear measure of the model's accuracy.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
### Grid Search:
- GridSearchCV is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model.
- This process involves testing various combinations of hyperparameters to find the best configuration that minimizes the RMSE.

### Best Model:
- The best model is selected based on the grid search results.
- The optimal parameters ensure that the model achieves the best possible performance.

## Future Predictions
### Feature Creation for Future Dates:
- An empty dataframe for future dates is created, and the same features as the training set are generated.
- This allows the model to make predictions on future time points.

### Scaling and Prediction:
- Future features are scaled using the same scaler fitted on the training data.
- Predictions are made using the trained XGBoost model.

### Visualization:
- Future predictions are visualized to provide a clear understanding of the expected future energy consumption.
- This visualization helps in assessing the model's forecasting ability and identifying potential trends.
